# Excel Scripts for do more with less effort.

## Script to remove duplicated checkboxes in same cell.

Someone gave me an excel file with 2600 checkboxes, with many overlapped in the same cell. I created a script to delete the overlapped checkboxes. Because of this the rendering process when you do scroll takes much time.

The file is: 'deleteDuplicatedCheckBoxes'
